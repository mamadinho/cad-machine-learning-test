# Simple PDF Table Extractor

This program can be used to extract table data from PDF (with certain format). The data will be stored into a CSV.

## How to use the program

The website (flask project) can be easily run just by running the command `python app.py` and go into the url given in the terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000) and enter the data on the forms. After pressing the button, the result will appear below the form.

The app can be used by running the command `python app.py file_name.pdf` and a CSV will be created on the same directory as the Python file.

## Suggestions

Check the results, as I haven't checked the results whether there are some missing words/rows.
